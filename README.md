# cholera-distinguishability
Code for cholera model comparison and distinguishability project. This code was built for:

Model distinguishability and inference robustness in mechanisms of cholera transmission and loss of immunity. Elizabeth C. Lee, Michael R. Kelly, Brad M. Ochocki, Segun M. Akinwumi, Karen E. S. Hamre, Joseph H. Tien, and Marisa C. Eisenberg. In revision. [arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.06790](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06790).

The code given here will simulate and fit data from five different models of cholera dynamics in a population, as well as fitting to data from the 2006 cholera epidemic in Angola. While this code generates some basic plots, Elizabeth Lee has also made much nicer R code available for plotting the resulting parameter estimates and fits at :octocat: eclee25/cholera-paramEstPlots.
